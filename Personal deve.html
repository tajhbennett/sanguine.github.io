            <li><b>Creativity</b></li>
            <p>
                Small creative activities can have an impact on a person overtime, I have used creativity in my daily life to aid in how I interact with people and how I do various actvities
                .<br>Creativity brings a sense of originality, with the idea of not being similar to others and be different in the things that I do such as problem solving and trying 
                other solutions to everyday issues <br>and implementing uniqueness into my daily practices. Creativity has always been one of my strengths which I will always improve on.
            </p>

            <li><b>Learning</b></li>
            <p>
                Utilizing the strength of learning tends to assist in the face of challenges. Learning is a strength which will always be prominent as we learn soemthing new everday.
                <br>Even though learning may not be fun when there are limitations, learning on my own accord and doing research on things that seems interesting helps to build cognitive skills
                and also the way that I think.<br>As time goes on I hope to build on my motivation when it comes to learning and also my personal interests and values.
            </p>

            <li><b>Humor</b></li>
            <p>
                Humor is utilized to gain intimacy, make people feel good, or as a stress reliever. Over the years humor is one of the qualities
                that brings hope, and spirituality, <br>while helping me to connect with others and give life value. Humor appreciation is correlated with other strengths such as wisdom and a desire to learn, as I stated above. 
                <br>Additionally, humor-related hobbies increases optimism and emotions. Humor is a strength on which I have a tendency to fall back on as it brings a sense of comfortabilty.
            </p>

        <font face="georgia"><p>
            <b>About:</b> A brief narrative about Michael, who met a millionaire. The millionaire told him about his journey to success and showed him how to apply the 12 principles to live a better life. 
            These twelve principles serve as the foundation for success. 
            This book by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener will motivate you to go above and beyond in your life, which will push and inspire you to grow into your best self.

        <center><font><h2>-4-<br><i>Achieve Your Goals</i></h2></font></center>
        <font face="georgia"><p>
            Setting goals entails deciding where you want to go and then devising a strategy to get there. 
            Setting goals that stretch you and force you to do things differently will lead you to the future you desire.<br>
            From this chapter it can be gathered that the author intends for the reader to set present goals and distant goals. I have dreams that I wish to accomplish
            which lead me to this instituation to gain a higher level of education to further strenghten my chances of achieving my goals.

        <font face="georgia"><p>
            We either bear the pain of discipline which weighs just ounces or we have to bear the pain of regret which weighs tons.
            Every day, your best opportunities are those that align with your overall goals and should be where you spend your time. Don't just finish the day; get from it. 
            Spend your time on what is important rather than what is urgent.<br>This chapter enlightened me on the idea of prioritzing myself more, 
            pouring more time into my goals and things that are relevant to me and having better management of time which would be a positive impact to my daily life.

        <font face="georgia"><p>
            Successful people seek relationships with other successful people who will push, and encourage them to grow. The people with whom you surround yourself with 
            affects the type of person you are and who you can become.<br>Associting my self with the right persons has always been idolized and I have stuck by it, keeping connections
            with are intelligible and goal driven who also boost me to do better.

        <font face="georgia"><p>
            Learning is the foundation of good health, wealth, and spirituality. As a result, self-education is critical because it is what you learn along the way that allows you to 
            constantly improve and grow in your life. Books are and will continue to be the best learning tools available to humanity. 
            <br>I totally agree that learning is something that is constant through our entire life, learning is listed as one a my strenghts as this already an aspect of my life and 
            what I feel is necessary to accomplish your goals.
